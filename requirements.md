## Vision

- **What is the vision of this product?**
A key feature of the conversational AIs is task-oriented dialogue: A feature that lets the user access information or topics or do some tasks through chatting. Thus, the need for domain-specific chatbots arises: a series of task-focused chat bots that are able to interact with users through command lines that help them with completing tasks like get data and do some tasks.

Chat bot in the command line will give prompts based on the user's answer. It will give the user topics to explore (weather , sports , movies etc ...)


- **What pain point does this project solve?**

**Problem** : Getting data about certain topics might need to go to each domain from multiple sources to get wanted data about this specific topic which is considered a waste of time and resources. 
Analyzing the data from these multiple resources might not be available to the ordinary users to get certain reports (ex: stock market data). And it might be hard to implement analysis and reports.

- **Why should we care about your product?**
Becaus our project provides the user with a a Command line chat bot that summarizes each topic in a brief way and displays it in a more efficient way that is easy to access. Which is considered a way to save time and resources.
The chatbot can offer the user detailed reports using AI implemented the data coming from the chosen resources.
